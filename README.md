Methdology:
Read the input CSV file containing alternatives and criteria values.

Validate that the number of weights and impacts matches the number of criteria.

Normalize the decision matrix to remove the effect of different units.

Multiply normalized values by their corresponding weights.

Determine the ideal best and ideal worst solutions based on impacts.

Calculate the distance of each alternative from both ideal solutions.

Compute the TOPSIS score for each alternative.

Rank alternatives in descending order of TOPSIS score and save the results
Impacts indicate whether higher (+) or lower (-) values are preferred.
